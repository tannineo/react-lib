# react-lib

My personal react library, with components.

## Hosting Storybook on GitHub Page

The static build of storybook is hosted on branch `gh-page`.

### Features

- `react`
- `vite`
- `typescript`
- `windicss`
  - `attributify: true` for tidier `className` grouping

### Subpath

Vite builder configuration `base` need to be set, if the static build is hosted under `https://<GITHUB_USERNAME>.github.io/<REPO_NAME>` but not `https://<GITHUB_USERNAME>.github.io/`

### Known Issues

- [ ] `.mdx` support for storybook, waiting for official solutions/updates.
